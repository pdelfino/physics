 + Projects: 
   - Modelling Table Tennis as the classic arcade game Pong.
   - Modelling a Solar Eclipse.
   
 + Support Material: Getting Started With Processing
 
# Pong

 I tried to model the real game. Hence, I kept the proportions between the objects involved, like the table, the racket and the ball size. In addition, I used the official colours.

I tried to model the real Solar System (Moon, Earth and Sun). Hence, I tried to keep the proportions between the objects.
